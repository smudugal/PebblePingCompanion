#PebblePingCompanion

PebblePingCompanion is the android companion app to PebblePing.

This app will allow you to "ping" your phone in case you misplaced it.

The intention is to have the Pebble app make the phone "ring" to broadcast the 
phone's presence.

Currently, the phone will play the default notification ringtone.
